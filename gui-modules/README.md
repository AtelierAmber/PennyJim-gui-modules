# Gui Modules
This is a library mod that was built for use with a gui-editor.
I got tired of not being able to use features I built into this, simply because I got stuck on a structural issue with its use with the editor.

Just as a warning to anyone who uses it:

# <span style="color:red">__USAGE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!__</span>
This is why I am not providing any documentation yet.

If you _are_ going to use it, depend on a specific version.
